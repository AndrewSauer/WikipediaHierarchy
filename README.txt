This project aims to create a sensible tree structure capturing all English Wikipedia articles. We will archive the site as it was on January 15, 2026 for its 25th anniversary.

This structure will be represented in the hierarchy of folders in this repository, and articles will be simple text files containing only a link to the Wikipedia page.

The integrity of this project will be checked automatically against a list of non-redirect article titles from the desired date, making sure that there are no duplicates, that every file in this repository is in the title list, and that every title in the title list is in this repository.
